## Pie Chart for current time slot

* Backend would provide a staistitics within date range and a particular 30 minutes time slot. Frontend would call it with current time slot, and last 100 days, and display as a pie chart.

* Display a 7 x 48 grid (excluding table headers). This is a representation of current week, starting from Monday to Sunday.
* The display is similar to the Home page, only everything is not selectable / clickable. There is also no type selector there.
